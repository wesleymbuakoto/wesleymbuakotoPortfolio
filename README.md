Created this portfolio from scratch using Google's Flutter framework. I was able to develop this multi-platform application using the skills taught in the Flutter Development Course created by Raywenderlich and Google, as well as the 2021 Flutter Development Bootcamp with Dart.

The project is currently deployed on the web as a website for Wesley Mbuakoto (myself). Also designed, stable, and tested for web, android, ios, and windows. This is possible by using Flutter's most recent 2.10 version. This portfolio project has a complete responsive design on every platform it is run on, and this has been tested thoroughly. While also keeping up with the modern standard of 60 frames per second on every platform, without hindering the performance of the device.

This portfolio is live at https://wesleymb.com/. This application will continue to be kept up to date, and will have more flutter features added to it
